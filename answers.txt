a) Project Manager is the equivalent to product owner in non-Agile Project

The product owner is responsible for maximising the product value, representing the stakeholders, prioritizing the backlog, empowering the team, maintaining Agile and Scrum processes and defining the product vision. 
The role of the product owner include the following:
    1) Managing stakeholders and driving value 
    2) Managing effective communication between the development team and stakeholders 
    3) Providing the product vision to the development team 
    4) Resolving conflicts and managing situations or escalations that may arise with stakeholders or development team members 
    5) Prioritising items on the backlog 
    6) Guiding the development team on Scrum values, principles and processes  
    7) Helping stakeholders understand the value of Scrum

b) A Scrum Master holds a position thatâ€™s relatively narrow in scope, yet extremely broad in influence throughout any organization. In practice, however, a Scrum Master is working behind the scenes and is not involved in product ideation or strategy. They work more as a conduit between product/line-of-business owners and development teams as a project manager. Because agile processes are entirely dependent on people and collaboration, Scrum Masters must also marry soft skills with the latest tools and methods. After all, software projects have many moving parts, and individual programmers can quickly lose sight of the broader scope when heads-down in code. A Scrum Master, on the other hand, maintains a high-level view, helping teams to understand both organizational and technical dependencies while avoiding chokepoints. This creates a culture of accountability and enables teams to meet critical deadlines.
